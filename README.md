I am a final-year Electrical and Electronic Engineering student at the University of Waikato.  
My interests include electronic design, embedded systems, and biomedical applications.  

## Current Project

**Development and Optimization of a Wearable Ultrasound Neuromodulation System**  
As part of my honours capstone project, I am working on testing and calibrating transcranial focused ultrasound (TUS) hardware, developing software tools for waveform control, and exploring pathways toward miniaturisation and integration into EEG-driven neuromodulation systems:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  

### Project Highlights
- Completed hydrophone-based acoustic calibration of an ultrasound transducer:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Drafted and circulated a custom transducer specification sheet to potential manufacturers:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Developing lightweight software to generate waveform files for a function generator, simplifying configuration and reuse:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
